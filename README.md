Analytical report (worksheet/dashboard) to analyze the company's sales of the Plan/Fact type.
- Plans indicators are always calculated only for one - selected - scenario.
- For all periods for which there are no plans in each specific scenario, you need to display the fact as a plan indicator (for example, if you selected the "Budget 2022 June Actual" scenario, the plan indicator up to and including June 2022 equals the fact).
- Monthly plans need to be broken down for each day in the month.
The data on which the analytical report will be based is updated daily (or on weekdays).
